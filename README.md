# CognoSeer
Using the Microsoft Facial Recognition API, CognoSeer takes event analytics to the next level. Every event planner knows how hard it is to find accurate stats about how their event went and use that to inform future plans. How many people showed up? What demographics attended in higher numbers? How did people feel during the event? All this information and more can be used to evaluate the performance of an event and provide planners with much needed information about it. 

Best of all, it's crowd-sourced. Instead of having to rely on their own limited set of photographs, planners can get images from participants. By using both their own images and those images from attendees, organizers get a vastly greater pool of data through Cognoseer.
